## News
ðŸ“£ **2025/10/27**: Our relabeled dataset and [final manuscript](https://papers.miccai.org/miccai-2025/0238-Paper3613.html) are now available online.

ðŸ“£ **Accepted at MICCAI 2025!** Check out our [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00438), and the dataset will be updated soon.

## Introducing DiGDA
We present DiGDA, a novel data augmentation method for lesion detection that generates realistic angiography images with varying levels of lesion severity by conditioning a diffusion model on lesion-specific vessel masks. 
Our pipeline produces high-quality synthetic images that preserve anatomical vessel structures while reflecting user-specified lesion severity, including highly severe cases. 
We demonstrate that incorporating these user-guided synthetic images into lesion detection pipelines significantly improves detection performance.  
As part of our contribution, we release the updated annotations of the [ARCADE dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10390295), specifically re-annotated for stenosis severity classification and lesion detection tasks.

## How to Use Our Dataset
1. Download images from [ARCADE dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10390295) and place them under the corresponding directory: `data/{split}/images`.
2. Check out our annotations:
  - Each annotation is provided in YOLO format: `class x_center y_center width height`. All coordinates are normalized by the original image size.
  - Class information:
    - **Class 0**: **Non-severe** lesion (%DS â‰¥ 50% and %DS < 70%) evaluated by our in-house experienced clinicians.
    - **Class 1**: **Severe** lesion (%DS â‰¥ 70%).
3. Train or evaulate your model using our relabeled dataset.
4. Share your experience with us!
  - We welcome feedback, suggestions, and collaboration.
  - Feel free to contact the authors (sumin.seo@medipixel.io).
